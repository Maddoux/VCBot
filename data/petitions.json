    "title": "Implement Retention Elections for all Administrators",
    "description": "Ever since I first came to VC, there was always an argument surrounding admin accountability. Some have maintained that recall petitions are perfectly fine, some have pushed for elected administrators, and some have called for retention elections. \n\nThroughout the years, VC has had a fair share of Administrators who have been either hostile towards the community's interests, or simply neglected their duties. Which has allowed for a multitude of different recall elections. However, like the last couple of recalls, whenever a petition is gathering signatures, there is a flood of \"I'll do better\" posts on twitter. Insults are thrown, feelings get hurt, and tensions are high. Recall elections have a proclivity for devolving into a toxic mess. This is leading to Admins who really shouldn't be on the team continuing their tenure (no I'm not talking about anyone in particular). On the flip side, elected Admins becomes less about competence and more about popularity. Especially when whipping is involved (and it can happen). There are people who may be popular with the server membership who have no business trying to lead it.\n\nSo, like in times past, I believe that it is prudent for the community to have a regular Missouri-style retention election system. While the power of appointment stays with the Administration team, the server itself gets its say as to whether Admin is a good fit. As we face yet another potential devolution into inactivity, we need an Admin team who has the confidence of the server to lead it. While this system is not perfect (and recall elections are still an option), it is leagues better than the status-quo.\n\nTherefore, We the Undersigned demand that a retention election system be implemented by the Administration. This system would call for a retention vote at regular intervals (say 120 days). This would not apply to Admins who have been appointed within a certain time (say 90 days).\n\nThank you.",

Activity has been dipping considerably, and attempts by players to engage with the simulation have gradually become rarer and rarer, as DE and IR slump into inactivity, the Press Orgs barely publish more than twice a month, and the Admins combat institutional problems with systemic neglect. For fear of controversy or instability or out of plain inability to create and implement effective solutions, the Admin team has been failing the community and must undergo a serious change.\n\nI do not believe that every admin needs to be removed, and I consider them all to be benefits to the community of Virtual Congress. However, the situation is becoming more and more dire. Fatalists who quote past prophecies of VC's doom as evidence for its eternal life are making the problem worse, and as the Admins do nothing, the staff and FEC continue to fall into consolidating decay and unpopularity. \n\nTo make the Admins actually use their extensive powers to improve the server, even at risk of controversy, the only option is either to recall the inactives or whip them into shape with the threat of recall.  And that is why I believe we should hold recall/retention elections on every member of the Admin team.",
